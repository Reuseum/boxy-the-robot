Setup Function:

Initializes serial communication for debugging purposes.
Connects to a Wi-Fi network using the provided SSID and password.
Initializes I2C communication.
Loop Function:

Reads the analog value from a potentiometer connected to channel 3 of a PCF8591T ADC.
Maps the potentiometer value to a PWM slider value.
Reads analog values from an X-axis and Y-axis joystick connected to channels 0 and 1 of the PCF8591T ADC.
Sends the joystick and PWM slider values to a server using HTTP GET requests.
Helper Functions:

readAnalogInput(): Reads analog input from channel 3 of the PCF8591T.
readAnalogX(): Reads X-axis analog input from channel 0 of the PCF8591T.
readAnalogY(): Reads Y-axis analog input from channel 1 of the PCF8591T.
sendValuesToServer(): Establishes a TCP connection with the server and sends joystick and PWM slider values via HTTP GET requests.
Regarding the ESP-01 module, this code should work if you have properly wired the ESP-01 to the PCF8591T ADC and the analog joystick. However, there are a few considerations:

Pin Compatibility: Ensure that the pins used in the code correspond to the pins physically connected on the ESP-01 module.

Power Requirements: Make sure the power requirements of all components (ESP-01, PCF8591T, and joystick) are met and properly supplied.

Wi-Fi Configuration: Verify that the SSID and password provided in the code match the Wi-Fi credentials of your network.

Server Configuration: Ensure that the server address and port are correctly set to the server that will receive the joystick and PWM slider values.

Debugging: Make use of serial output for debugging purposes to ensure the ESP-01 is connecting to Wi-Fi and sending data to the server as expected.

As long as these considerations are addressed and the hardware is properly set up, the code should work with the ESP-01 module.
