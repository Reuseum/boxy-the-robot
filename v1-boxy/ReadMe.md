This robot code is made for Reuseum Educational Inc. Boxy the Robot

This code is for a 2wd robot made out of a box and an esp8266 NODEMCU v1. It uses virtualjoystick from https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js to control the robot's movement via a web interface.

v1-boxy code uses const char joystick_html[] instead of spifs and does not have a LED button or speed slider.
